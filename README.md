# sd-webui-DTG
A simple adaptation of Kohaku's [DanTagGen](https://huggingface.co/KBlueLeaf/DanTagGen?not-for-all-audiences=true) Demo into an a1111 extension. Almost all of the code was taken straight from the original demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/KBlueLeaf/DTG-demo
# Purpose
I was tired of switching between browser tabs every generation and accidentally ooming. This is primarily for personal use but I figured I'd make the repo public for anyone who's too lazy to do the same.
# Supported a1111 versions:
It works on my machine üëç
